# About Wix Loyalty

Wix site owners can install the Wix Loyalty Program app to their site to create a loyalty program for their customers. It allows customers to earn points that they can redeem for rewards.

Wix Loyalty APIs allow you to activate, update, and manage a siteâ€™s loyalty program, including details about the overall loyalty program and customer accounts. Additionally, from [a site owner's Dashboard](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Select%20Site&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https:%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fdashboard%2F%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D%2Floyalty-accounts/wizard/), they can define automations that give their customers points based on certain actions that are currently not available via the API. See [Wix Loyalty Program: An Overview](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-loyalty-program-an-overview) for more details.

Wix Loyalty APIs allow your app to:

* Activate the program.
* Customize the program, point name, and point icon.
* Create customer accounts.
* Manage account point balances.

## Terminology

* **Program name:** Customizable name of the program.
* **Point:** The collectible unit of the program.
* **Account:** Every customer has an account that tracks their point balance, points earned and points redeemed.
* **Customer:** Can be a site member or a contact.

## Limitations

* There can only be one loyalty program per Wix site.
* Only a program that has been installed in a Wix site can be activated.
* Each customer can have only one loyalty account.
* Currently, your app cannot set automatic earning rules for purchases. A site owner can set them up through their dashboard. To learn how, check out this article for an [overview on the Wix Loyalty Program](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-loyalty-program-an-overview).
