## Use Cases

This article shares some possible use cases your app can support. You are not limited to these use cases, but they can be a helpful jumping off point as you plan your integration.

### Create a "top ratings" showcase

An online store owner may want to show a selection of the top rated products in their store, either on their own site, or perhaps on a different site as advertising highlighting their satisfied customers.

1. Filter ratings by 5 rating to return only top rated products.
2. Retrieve these products' data from the Wix Stores API.
3. Create a widget to display the top rated products.

### Add poll functionality

A social site owner may want to add a poll to enable site visitors to leave their opinions on a topic, vote on their favorite video or podcast episodes, or help decide the next topic for a discussion.

1. Create an interface for the site owner to provide details of the poll options.
2. Set up the poll options as a rating using Ratings Configuration.
3. Show how many visitors voted in total with totalRatings and results per option with ratingsBreakdown

### Create a custom product ranking

Store owners with a wide range of similar products, or a customer base with very specific needs, might want to customize the way their products are recommended, for example, when a particular aspect of a product, such as value for money, is very important to a group of customers.

1. Get top rated products for value for money
2. Sort within results to rank the best performers in this category.
