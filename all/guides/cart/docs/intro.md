# About the eCommerce Cart API

The cart is the first phase of a purchase, followed by checkout, then order. Carts can be created, managed, and used to create a checkout with the Cart API.

Calculate the cart's totals (including taxes and shipping costs) using the [Estimate Totals](https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs/rest/ecommerce/cart/estimate-totals) endpoint.

A cart holds information about purchased items, prices, discounts, site details, buyer IDs (contact and member/visitor) and the cart subtotal.

The eCommerce Cart API replaces the soon-to-be deprecated [Stores Carts API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-stores/carts).
To assist in moving from the old API to the new, please refer to the [cart conversion table](https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs/rest/ecommerce/cart/cart-object-conversion).
