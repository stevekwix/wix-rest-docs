# About Wix Events

[Wix Events](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-events) allows site owners to create and manage events, including selling tickets or collecting RSVPs.

## Terminology
- **Event** - a type of gathering an individual or a business holds for a group of people. Our APIs support 3 different types of events:
  - RSVP events: Free events that collect RSVPs - yes/no attendance tracking (e.g., a wedding).
  - Ticketed events: Events which have tickets for sale (e.g., a conference).
  - External registration events: Events where the registration occurs on a different website and the events within the Wix platform are display-only.  
- **Ticket definition** - the settings that define the ticket options available for purchase for ticketed events. Name, price and currency are required for each ticket definition.
- **Policy** - free-text that defines terms & conditions and other policies, as relevant.

> **NOTE**:  
A Wix service fee of 2.5% is charged for each ticket sold. This fee can either be passed on to the buyer or absorbed by the event owner.
