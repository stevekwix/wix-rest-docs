# Introduction

Wix Events will allow you to easily create and manage events, and enjoy many features, 
such as the ability to collect guest RSVPs, sell tickets, manage the guest list and check guests in.

### What can you do with it?

1. Create events (unlimited) by filling out the relevant event details.
2. Choosing between guests RSVPing to event or purchasing tickets.
3. Guests see the events, can read about them in dedicated event details page (optional) and signs up to the event. 
4. User manages guest list, can see who RSVPd and/or purchased tickets, and check them in as arrived, on the event day.

### What is an event?

Each event is defined by the user for his website and contains the following data properties:
1. General info: event title, description, rich text about section.
2. Scheduling information: start and end date times, time zone of the event etc.
3. Location (with assistance of map coordinates).
4. Customizable registration form (*).
5. Optional ticket selling (ticket definitions) (*).
6. External registration link

(*) customizable only in Wix Events dashboard

There are 3 types of events available:
 - **rsvp** - a response type (yes/no)
 - **tickets** - selling of the tickets
 - **external** - registration managed on external website

#### Registration (RSVP)

When a guest responds to a RSVP **Registration Form** then a new RSVP 
is created *and a confirmation email is sent*.

Rsvp registration settings can be configured in Business Manager.
Rsvp options can be Yes only or Yes and No. 

Limiting the number of guests is optional. Once the guest list is
full the registration is closed, unless Waitlist is enabled.

*If user RSVP to Waitlist, he will get a email once 
additional space in event is available*

#### Tickets

To start selling tickets, the user needs to set the ticket definition 
(title, price, amount of tickets available, currency and an optional 
short description).

Once the first is ticket defined, the event becomes a ticketed event 
(event type **tickets**).

To register to the event: the guest has to choose the tickets, 
fill out the **Registration Form** and checkout. An order is created
and if tickets are not free then payment has to be made. *Once payment
is received the confirmation email with attached tickets PDF is sent to
the guest.*

Payment collection is provided by [Cashier](https://wixplorer.wixpress.com/cashier-pay/reference)

#### External

Registration button can be linked to an external website from 
the business manager. Once this option is selected event guest 
management (RSVP, tickets) is disabled. 

#### Registration Form

The Registration Form is customizable so the site visitor will 
be able to fill in his details and RSVP to the event or purchase 
tickets in check-out. Users are able to add custom form inputs 
with free text and also pre-defined options (such as a drop-down 
list and radio buttons). The only inputs fields which are fixed: 
First name, Last name and Email.
