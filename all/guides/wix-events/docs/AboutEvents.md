# About the Events API

An event is a type of gathering an individual or a business holds for a group of people. 

Wix Events support 3 different types of events:
- **RSVP events**: Free events that collect RSVPs - yes/no attendance tracking (e.g., a wedding).
- **Ticketed events**: Events which have tickets for sale (e.g., a conference).
- **External registration events**: Events where the registration occurs on a different website and the event within the Wix platform is display-only.

Each event can include the following properties:
- **General info**: event title, description, rich text about section.
- **Scheduling information**: start and end date times, time zone of the event etc.
- **Location** (including map coordinates).
- **Registration form** settings.
- **Ticket definition** settings (for Ticketed Events).
- **External registration** link (for External Registration Events).
